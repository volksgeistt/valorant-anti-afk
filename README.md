# **VALORANT Anti-AFK**

A Python script that **automates keyboard actions** using `pyautogui`, allowing you to go AFK in Valorant rounds **without getting AFK banned**.

## **Features** 🌐

✅ **Message Spammer** – Spam any text with custom intervals.  
✅ **Random Anti-AFK Movement** – Simulates real movement with:

- Random key presses (`WASD` or custom keys).
- Occasional **weapon switching** (`2, 3, E`).
- **Auto-jumping** & **Auto-crouching** for realism.
- Small **mouse movements** to prevent AFK detection.
- Adjustable **runtime limit** for control.

## **Installation & Usage** 💻

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r req.txt
   ```
2. Run the script using the batch file:
   ```sh
   start.bat
   ```
3. Follow on-screen instructions to select **Auto-Typer** or **Anti-AFK Mode**.
